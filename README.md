* changes that have not yet been included in a stable release

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Create a Discord Bot

Before running Martin, you need to create a Discord application and bot.

1. Open the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Click **New Application**.
3. Give your application a name.
4. Open the **Bot** section.
5. Click **Add Bot**.
6. Copy the bot's **Token** and keep it private.

> 🔐 **Never share your bot token or commit it to GitHub.**
>
> If your token is exposed, regenerate it from the Discord Developer Portal.

### 2. Invite the Bot

Open the **Installation** section of your Discord application and configure the installation settings.

Make sure the bot has the permissions required by the features you intend to use.

You can then use the generated installation link to add Martin to your server.

### 3. Configure Martin

Rename the example configuration files:

```text
.env.example       → .env
config.json.example → config.json
```

Open both files and configure them according to your setup.

> ⚠️ Keep `.env` and other files containing private credentials out of version control.

### 4. Start Martin

Martin provides startup scripts for both Windows and Linux.

#### Windows

Run:

```text
start_bot.bat
```

#### Linux

Run:

```bash
./start_bot.sh
```

The startup scripts are the **recommended way to start Martin**.
